# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Answer for why is timely delivery crucial in software project management
- To keep all the stakeholders happy and satisfied
- To increase profit of the business
- To improve and protect business reputation
Answer for how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
- By using charts like Gantt, (PERT) Program Evaluate Review Technology, and (CPM) Critical Path          Method, These tools will help a project manager to know what task and activities should be done and what is not finished. 
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Answer for how does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project?
- Effective cost control help project managers to estimate their costs, allocate resources to the right areas, and control overall spending. Cost management plans keep all project costs in one place, including direct and indirect costs.
Answer for what strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
- Good planning with the help of (WBS) Work BreakDown structure, so that every project can broke down and distribute among team members.
- Making a use of (CBA) Cost Benefit Analysis, to identify and quantify the expected costs of the project and compares this costs to the expected benefits.
- Having a consistent communication with the stakeholders. 
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer for Agile methodologies
The Agile methodologies are a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement.
Advantages of Agile methodologies
-	Customer satisfaction
-	Increase flexibility
-	Reduce risk
-	Best quality control
-	Continuous improvements
Disadvantages of Agile methodologies
-	Less predictable
-	More time and commitment is needed
-	Lack of necessary documentation
-	Project can easy fall off track..
-	Answer for Agile methodologies
Answer for Waterfall methodologies
-	Waterfall methodologies are names this way because it reflects how the process move along from one phase to the next when the previous phase is finished. However going over the edge of a waterfall is a big step so the team needs to be sure that they are complete ready for the next phase before they take plunge.
Advantages of Agile methodologies
-	It fully identifies the system requirements long before programming begins
-	It minimises changes to requirements during the development project
Disadvantages of Waterfall methodologies
-	The documents are long and difficult  to understand so users do not always pick up the problems or mission functionality in design
- Inflexibility. Its lack of revision opportunities means it’s almost impossible to make changes mid-development. Also, changing the scope during the project's life cycle can bring the project to an end or require nearly starting over.
-	Doesn’t suit complex projects. It is not the best to use for high-risk or complex projects.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile Project examples
-	Aircraft
-	Scrum
-	eXtreme Programming (XP)
Waterfall Project examples
-	Healthcare projects 
-	Construction building
-	Manufacturing companies
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Answer for what are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project?  
Ensuring quality assurance in a software development project involves evaluating the QA outcomes regularly. Monitor test results, bug reports, and test coverage to assess the effectiveness of testing efforts. Conduct reviews and retrospectives to identify areas for improvement in QA processes and methodologies
Answer for why is it important to maintain high standards?
High standard help ensure that developers build software in a consistent and predictable way, reducing the risk of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other defects.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer for how does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning
-	A project manager uses the scope to define the project plan for the project. I helps to define the size and complexity which are needed for estimated many of the components of the plan. Without a clear idea of what is included or not in a project, it is difficult for the project manager to and development team to complete a project successfully
Answer for what is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
- Work Breakdown Structure is a way of dividing a project into manageable sections that can be more easily planned for and managed. The sections are divided again into smaller and smaller sections until they are small enough to be assigned to an individual to complete. WBS are very useful because they help a project manager to plan, budget, schedule, monitor and report on projects. 
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Answer 
-	Detailed project schedule helps the project manager to know which task need to be finished first before others start.
-	It also benefits project manager to decide when the various activities and task will be done and who will do them
-	Gantt charts are very detailed as they show start date and end date of each activity, and they also show duration of activities, dependency relationships between them and current schedule status. So this proves that Gantt charts assist project manager to know everything about a project.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
-	To address the issue of livestock farmer they don’t have to always be available in farm, I’m looking forward to develop software that will automatically feed or dish up for livestock.
-	To save time and energy most of livestock farmers in my country are people who are working on corporate and government.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
-	By clearly defining a problem, you may get the opportunity to understand the root cause of it. In Addition, it could have the potential benefit of bringing further revenue to the company. You also may have the opportunity to bring different team members together to collaborate.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
-	The purpose of my software is to dish up for livestock 
-	The only part that I person will be required to do is to put food in a tank, and then my software ware will scoop food that is in the tank.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
-	Good hardware which will be embedded with my source code to insure that my software is doing the task accurately
-	Best digital feature that are easy to change and replace
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
-	There is a huge market size of livestock farmers in my area and they all complain about the same issue, this prove that my software might be in high demand when is launched.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
-	Market trends might appreciate my software because this application is going to make sure that animals are being feed with little help from people.
